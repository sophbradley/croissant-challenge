      <p class="mt-5 info-paragraph">
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by
        the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
        laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent
        shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times
        in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to
        a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the
        Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but
        using brioche dough. Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and
        French bakeries and p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in
        the early 20th century when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of
        the kipferl with a yeast-leavened laminated dough.
